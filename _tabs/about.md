I’m **Abdulkerim Kılıç**, a backend engineer with several years of experience building and maintaining production systems, primarily in the **.NET ecosystem**.

My background is mostly backend-focused, with hands-on experience in **Web APIs, SQL-based systems, and business-critical applications**, especially in regulated domains like banking and finance. I’ve worked on systems where correctness, consistency, and maintainability matter more than hype.

This site is not a blog in the traditional sense.  
It’s a **technical reference** that complements my CV.

Here you’ll find:
- Short **engineering notes** about architectural decisions and trade-offs  
- **Project write-ups** explaining *why* certain designs were chosen  
- Selected topics I’ve studied or applied while preparing for **technical interviews**

I’m interested in:
- Backend architecture and system design  
- Writing boring but reliable software  
- Understanding where common patterns actually break in real systems

I don’t claim to know everything, and I avoid pretending otherwise.  
The goal of this site is simple: to show **how I think as an engineer**, not to teach tutorials or chase trends.
